# Common Array Patterns

- **Two pointers:** start/end pointers for pairs, reversing, partitioning.
- **Sliding window:** variable-size or fixed-size window for subarray sums, averages.
- **Prefix sums:** precompute sums for fast range queries.
- **Frequency/counting:** use auxiliary arrays or maps for counting occurrences.

## When to apply

Choose pattern based on problem constraints (sorted vs unsorted, window size, need for in-place operations).
