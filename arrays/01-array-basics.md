# Array Basics

- **Definition:** Ordered collection of elements, fixed size.
- **Access:** O(1) by index.
- **Common operations:** traversal, insertion (shift), deletion (shift), search.

## Notes

- Use when you need contiguous memory and constant-time index access.
- Consider dynamic arrays (ArrayList) in Java for resizable behavior.
