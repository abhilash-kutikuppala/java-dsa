# Array + HashMap Patterns

- **Frequency counting:** use a HashMap to count occurrences when range is large or values are non-integer.
- **Index mapping:** map values to indices for quick lookups (two-sum, complements).
- **Grouping by key:** bucket elements by computed key (anagrams, modulo groups).

## Tips

- When counts are small and range is limited, prefer arrays for lower overhead.
- HashMap offers flexibility for complex keys (tuples, strings).
